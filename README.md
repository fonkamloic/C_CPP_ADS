# ALGORITHM, DATA STRUCTURES AND PROBLEM SOLVING BASED ON HEMANT JAIN'S BOOKS

Originally I was thinking of making this project contain implementations of ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURE  in C and C++. But after mush thought, I have decided to make this project contain tool-set for my upcoming real project that will be using the following technologies [list](#list-of-technologies). 
The project will consist of two parts;

The first part will be the implementation of both basic and complex ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES in [list](#list-of-technologies). The approach of implementation will be as generic and highly documented as possible for later code reuse.

The second part will be providing solution to problems from the books "Problem solving in Data Structure and algorithm using [list](#list-of-technologies)". This part of the project will be to apply the knowledge gotten from the first part in most efficient and real-world-like way.

# HOW WILL THE IMPLEMENTATION LOOK LIKE?

Every implementation of a data structure should contain a separate documentation on the approach of implementation, that is all the operation that are carried out on the data structure and all the function/method used indicating their prototype and brief description in such a way someone that can implement a function/method just by reading the documentation.

Also the documentation should contain a todo list of all the parts of the implementation [ the function/methods and their interrelation with each other]. The various parts of the todo list should have check-boxes to indicate if their implementation is complete or not. 

#uncomplete...
