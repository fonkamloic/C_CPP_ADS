#HOW WILL ALL THE SOURCE CODES IN VARIOUS LANGUAGE WORK?

After most of the algorithms have been implementated in most language, A bash script will be in written that will serve as a central point where all the algorithms and/or data structures can be tried out. 

The script will be display a menu of all programming language and data structures available, where a choice can be made. when a choice is made, if it is a shell programming language that has been choosen, then it will run in the same process. else and external process will be call will the specific programming language call where the algorithms in that programming language can be tested.

If the requirements/dependencies to run a specific programming language are not available, then the script carries on to download those will the permission of the user.
