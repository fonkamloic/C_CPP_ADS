The following functionalities will be posible on the linked list;

1- insertion in the front O(1)
2- insertion in the back O(1)
3- deletion in the front or back O(1)
4- insertion at position n O(n)
5- traversal of list 0(n/2) ## n/2 using two pointers to traverse the list faster
6- deletion at position n O(n/2) ## using two pointers to find note to delete
7- get list mid point O(n/2)
8- delete entire list O(n)
